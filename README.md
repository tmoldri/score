# Score of Life
This is sample project created for showcasing some code. 

# Installing
Vendor, configuration and database files are already included in this project in effort to make installing it as simple as possible. There should not be any commands or tweaking needed to get this working. Just clone it from github to your htdocs folder (or to your virtual host folder) and open the url in a browser.

# Usage
You have to log into the application in order to see most of the functionality. The test user is already provided and is already selected when you got to the login page. You are free to register a new user if needed.

# Live preview
Coming soon...
